Hello, everyone.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
Today we are going to try out this AIM 2 map for Counter Strike 2,
it's exactly called the map.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
Here's the QR code to scan it.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
This map is basically practice with all the game's weapons to improve AIM, accuracy.

00:21.000 --> 00:31.000
In the first case, we will use the AK to practice a bit.
We'll be killing enemies for a while so you can see more or less what it would be like to practice on this map.

00:31.000 --> 00:51.000
As you can see, the farther away the distance, the harder it would be to hit the head.
We can move around this entire area within this mini circle.

00:51.000 --> 01:15.000
Now we'll switch to the M4A1-S which comes with the silencer.
As we can see, it's harder to hit with the bullets than with the previous weapon.
It's harder to kill enemies.

01:15.000 --> 01:27.000
Now finally, we'll use the AWP, which is the sniper rifle of the game.
I haven't mentioned it before, but as we can see, there are different ranges of distance,

01:27.000 --> 02:09.000
some are farther and others closer to practice distances, especially which is very important in this game.

02:09.000 --> 02:38.000
Now we'll practice the Deagle, which is the best pistol, the one that kills with one shot to the head.
As we can see, it kills with three shots to the chest, but with the head only with one, regardless of whether you wear a helmet or not.

02:38.000 --> 03:14.000
That would be the end of the video, it's a mini compilation of this map.
I highly recommend it since all the game's weapons are here, and you can adjust the range of distances and all the objects it has depending on this panel here.

03:14.000 --> 03:28.000
Goodbye.
